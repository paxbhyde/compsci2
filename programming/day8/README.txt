Implement the IDict interface backed by a list and binary search tree. Name the list backed implementation "Dict" and the BST backed implementation "BSTree". The files "shortlist.txt" and "words_alpha.txt" should not be committed to your repository.
You should copy over your best list implementation from day 4 to use as the list in the Test program.

Files:
Test.java  - A program that reads in words and randomly searches for them
keysTest.java  –  A program to test the .keys() function of ListDict and BSTree.
removeTest.java  –  A program to test the .remove() function of ListDict and BSTree. (remove does not work)
IList.java - An interface for a list implementation (matches day4)
ISLink.java - An interface that your link cells for SingleLinkList must implement
SLink.java  - Implementation for link cells in a singlely linked list.
SingleLinkList.java – Singly-linked list implementation of IList.
IDict.java - An interface for dictionaries
Dict.java  – Singly link list based implementation of IDict.
Entry.java  – Object class for use in list-backed dictionary.
BSTree.java  – Binary tree implementation of IDict.
Node.java  –  Object class for use in binary tree backed dictionary.
shortlist.txt - a 50000 word list
words_alpha.txt - a 370098 word list
